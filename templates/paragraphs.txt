<h3>Do you have 'pubic' or 'resluts' misspellings on your website? It's more common than you think...</h3>

<p><em>'Pubic'</em> is the most common misspelling of the word <em>'public'</em>, but its antonym <em>'private'</em> is also notoriously being misspelled at times as 'primate'. If you're in the public sector, this is one to look out for!</p>

<p>A third commonly misspelled word we find through the Monsido tool is the word <em>'results'</em>, which can be misspelled as <em>'resluts'</em>.</p>

<p>These misspellings are common and can damage an organisationâ€™s reputation. We're all human and these errors will pop up. You just need a tool to pick up on the human errors...</p>

<p>To tackle these awkward misspellings, Monsido helps organisations automate finding and fixing these errors using our Policies tool and Quality Assurance tool.</p>
